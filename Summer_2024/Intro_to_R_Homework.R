## Exercises
# 1. Read in diamonds.csv data and call it 'df', you will need to change the path in quotes to your local machine to use read.csv
df <-read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwartler/teaching-datasets/main/diamonds.csv')

# 2. Examine the first 10 rows of data
head(__, __)

# 3. What is the first value for the 'color' column when looking at head()? 
# Answer: 

# 4. Create a new data frame called 'diamonds' by sorting the 'df' object by price and decreasing is FALSE
_____ <- __[___(__$____, decreasing=_),]

# 5. Examine the last 6 rows by calling 'tail()' on the 'diamonds' data frame.  What is the most expensive diamond in the set?
___(____)
# Answer: 

# 6. Copy and paste the results of the 'summary()' stats for the 'caret' attribute below.  You can use either $ or the index to get the vector


# Introducing additional functions to try out, don't worry these are straight forward:
?max
?min
?range

# 7. What is the maximum value for the "depth" attribute?
# Answer:

# 8. What is the minimum value for the "table" attribute?
# Answer: 

# 9. What is the range of values for the "price" column?
# Answer:

# 10. Find the 347th diamond in the data set using row indexing.  Copy paste the single row below.


# 11. Create a barplot of the diamonds' cut column.  Using jpeg() as the function create a file "barplot.jpg" then create the bar plot so it is saved to disk.




# 12. Create a ggplot scatterplot of points with the following aesthetics:
# color = clarity
# x axis = carat
# y axis = price
# point size size = 0.25
# theme = theme_economist_white()
# legend = none




# 13. Examine the price distribution by creating a ggplot geom_histogram() instead of a scatter plot layer.  Use the code scaffold below with the following parameters:
# data = diamonds
# type = geom_histogram
# x = price (we are only examining a single attribute here)
# bin width = 100

____(data= _____) + ________(aes(x=____), binwidth=___)


#14. What is the class() of the carat vector?  HINT: apply class() as a function to the carat column using $ or index number


#15. What is the class of the color vector?


#16. Read in the WesternCellTowers.csv cell towers as westTowers
westTowers <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwartler/teaching-datasets/main/WesternCellTowers.csv')

#17. Using map() create a state map of 'oregon', 'utah', 'nevada', 'california' & add points() with westtowers$lon,westtowers$lat, col='blue'


#18. Load the county map data called counties (HINT: with map_data)
counties <- ____('____')

#19. Load the state data called state 
allStates <- _____('____')

#20. Subset counties and allStates into the objects below; add the last states, california & nevada to the search index
westernCounties <- ____[____$____ %in% c("oregon","utah", "_____", "_____"),]
westernStates   <- ____[____$____ %in% c("oregon","utah", "_____", "_____") ,]


#21. Create a ggplot map of the cell phone towers in the 4 western states.  Refer to the lesson's example code.
