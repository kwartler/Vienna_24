# libraries

# Obtain the data - find the raw data on https://github.com/kwartler/teaching-datasets/tree/main/diabetes_tables

# Join the data

# Scrub the data - account for missing variables

# Create a DTM from the drNotes column

# Explore the data

# Arrange into a modeling matrix with both original data and the DTM & save a copy

# Success for day 1 is a modeling matrix that has been cleaned meaning no missing data, dummy variables have been created, the DTM is represented (cbind) and there are one or more engineered variables
# End
