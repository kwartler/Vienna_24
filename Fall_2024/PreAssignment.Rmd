# Pre-class Assignment: Introduction to R for Business Analytics

## Objective

The aim of this pre-assignment is help you catch up to others in the cohort that attended the Harvard session.  This is meant to help you familiarize yourself with R. Your learning objectives include:

1. Loading data into R 
2. Perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. Create visualizations using ggplot2 (and I also like ggthemes).
4. Fit a basic linear regression model and interpret its output.  My expectation is that you understand a linear regression as its from statistics and shouldn't be *to* complicated.
5. Examine the model and identify some relevant KPIs.

## Data

We'll use a dataset from Kaggle called [Superstore Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/jr2ngb/superstore-data). This dataset includes 10,000 rows and several useful columns for our analysis, including:

- Order ID
- Ship Mode
- Segment
- Country
- City
- State
- Postal Code
- Region
- Category
- Sub-Category
- Sales
- Quantity
- Discount
- Profit

The data deals with a company's sales and profits for different products across various regions, which will give us a solid basis to apply data analytics skills in a realistic business scenario.

Please download the file and load into the R environment.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Load the Data

You'll be loading data from a CSV file into R which requires the `read.csv` function.

```r
# Load Data
SuperstoreData <- read.csv("SuperstoreSales.csv", header = TRUE)
```

### Step 2: Explore the Data

Use the `str()` and `summary()` functions to glean important characteristics about your dataset.

```r
# Check the structure of data
str(SuperstoreData)

# Obtain summary statistics for the data
summary(SuperstoreData)
```

### Step 3: Visualization

Let's visualize the relationship between "Discount" and "Profit" using ggplot2.

```r
# Load the ggplot2 library
library(ggplot2)

# Scatterplot of Discount vs. Profit
ggplot(SuperstoreData, aes(x = Discount, y = Profit)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Discount vs Profit",
       x = "Discount",
       y = "Profit")
```

### Step 4: Fit a Regression Model

Now, we'll use a linear regression model to test if "Discount" can predict the "Profit". 

```r
# Fit a simple linear regression model
model <- lm(Profit ~ Discount, data = SuperstoreData)

# Print model summary
summary(model)
```

### Step 5: Assess the Model

Interpret the model results. Examine the model's coefficients, R-squared, F-statistics, and p-values. 

Some questions to consider:

- How well does the model explain the variation?
- Are the model's predictors significant? 

Capture your observations.

## Deliverable

Submit your well-structured, thoroughly-commented R script including outputs. Also, provide your interpretation and insights obtained from the regression model.

Please remember to draw upon those insights to summarize what you learned about how discounts appear to impact profits from the data.
