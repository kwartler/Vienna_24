Advanced Note:

This file has been perturbed to include NA and outliers for numeric and factor columns.  However as this was done through a function [not manually] some issues may have been created unintentionally.  As a backup for the assignment, you are also free to use the original data set in the basic track and apply the advanced assignment requirements.
