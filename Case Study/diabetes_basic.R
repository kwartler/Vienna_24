# Obtain the data
diabetesData <- read.csv('https://github.com/kwartler/teaching-datasets/raw/main/diabetes_tables/diabetes_subset_8500.csv')

# Scrub the data - check for missing, outliers etc

# Explore the data - create a lot of visuals and summary statistics understanding aspects of the data, correlations, frequencies etc

# Identify the name of the inputs and the prediction column


# Drop the description columns

# Based on your exploration, arrange the columns that are most relevant into a modeling matrix & save a copy

# Success in day one is having a flat file saved with input variables and the y variable ready for tomorrow's modeling.
